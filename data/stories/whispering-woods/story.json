  "startingPrompt": "You are a young adventurer who has spent weeks following ancient maps and cryptic legends to reach this place. Standing at the edge of the legendary Whispering Woods, you feel the weight of your quest: finding the Crystal of Eternal Spring, said to restore balance to the changing seasons.\n\nAncient trees tower before you, their gnarled branches seeming to murmur secrets in languages forgotten by time. Shafts of golden sunlight filter through the emerald canopy, creating dancing patterns on the moss-covered ground. The air hums with an almost tangible magic, making your skin tingle with anticipation.\n\nAs you pause to gather your courage, a melodic voice drifts from somewhere within the forest depths: \"Another seeker comes to test their worth... but do they possess the wisdom to succeed where others have failed?\"\n\nThe voice fades, leaving only the gentle rustle of leaves. Your leather satchel contains basic supplies, a worn map, and your grandmother's silver compass that brought you this far. The forest beckons, but multiple paths wind into its mysterious depths.",
