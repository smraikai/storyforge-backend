  "startingPrompt": "You stand at the edge of the legendary Whispering Woods, where ancient trees seem to murmur secrets in languages forgotten by time. Shafts of golden sunlight filter through the emerald canopy, creating dancing patterns on the moss-covered ground. The air hums with an almost tangible magic, and you can hear the distant sound of... something. Perhaps running water, perhaps whispered conversations between the trees themselves. You've come here seeking the Crystal of Eternal Spring, but the path ahead is shrouded in mystery. What do you do first?",
