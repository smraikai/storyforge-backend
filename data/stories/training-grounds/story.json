  "startingPrompt": "You find yourself standing in the first chamber of what appears to be an ancient training facility. The heavy oak door behind you seals shut with an audible click, and torchlight flickers across weathered stone walls.\n\nIn the center of the room stands a sturdy wooden table, its surface worn smooth by countless hands. Various objects are scattered across it - some mundane, others curious, all seemingly placed with purpose. The flickering torchlight makes it difficult to make out all the details from where you stand.\n\nAcross the room, you notice another door - this one also locked, with a keyhole glinting in the torchlight. It's clear you'll need to find a key to progress further into this mysterious complex.\n\nThe air carries the scent of old parchment and burning oil, with an underlying current of something else - anticipation, perhaps, or the lingering presence of previous adventurers who have walked this path before you.\n\nYou sense this is just the beginning of a multi-stage challenge. What secrets does the table hold, and what lies beyond that second door?",
